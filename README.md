- Hello, my name is Joseph Malham. I'm currently a third year physics student at UCLA, and enjoy working on anything that involves physical modeling as well as data analysis/management.
- My current work is oriented around the CMS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, specifically developing Unity-based VR event displays. I work under the guidance of one of UCLA's experimental particle physicists/professor, as well as a CERN particle physicist located in Geneva. I work alongside another third year UCLA physics undergraduate.
- I have 3 years of experience doing various Python projects. The past year, I have taken more initiative in developing my Python skills past what I have been taught in class.
- Lately, I've been spending some of my free time trying to learn more about React and web development as a whole, rather than just desktop stuff.
