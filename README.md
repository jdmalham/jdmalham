- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Joseph Malham. I'm currently a third year physics student at UCLA, and enjoy working on anything that involves modeling as well as data analysis/management.
- I have 3 years of experience doing various Python projects. The past year, I have taken more initiative in developing my Python skills past what I have been taught in class.
- Lately, I've been spending some of my free time trying to learn more about React and web development as a whole, rather than just desktop stuff.
- If you'd like to contact me, my email is jmalham100@gmail.com. Serious inquiries only.
